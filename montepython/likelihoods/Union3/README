First version of the Pantheon_Plus and Pantheon+SH0ES likelihoods from  

Pantheon+ arXiv:2202.04077 and SH0ES arXiv:2112.04510

based on former Pantheon likelihood by Rodrigo von Martens which was based on the JLA likelihood
it is the Montepython adaptation of the lkl written for cosmosis and available at https://pantheonplussh0es.github.io/

author: Vivian Poulin <vivian.poulin@umontpellier.fr> with help from Dillon Brout and Dan Scolnic

##instructions##

1) move the "Pantheon_Plus" and "Pantheon_Plus_SH0ES" folder to within your montepython/likelihoods folder
2) move the content of the data folder to the data folder of montepython.
3) you can run with either Pantheon_Plus or with Pantheon_Plus_SH0ES. 
4) Just as for the former Pantheon data, the only nuisance parameter is "M" the SN1a intrinsic magnitude. Don't forget to include it in a run:

data.parameters['M']	   = [-19.2, -30, -10, 0.5,  1, 'nuisance']


## Note ##

The Pantheon_Plus_SH0ES uses additional cepheid distances as a calibrator of the SN1a magnitude.
It cannot be used with an additional prior on H0 / Mb, or with the Pantheon_Plus lkl.
It should work with both Python2 and Python3. In case of a problem write to <vivian.poulin@umontpellier.fr>
and don't forget to cite arXiv:2202.04077  arXiv:2112.04510

Thanks!
