# Supernovae Type Ia likelihoods

**Contributors:** Anton Chudaykin

This repo contains the SN Ia likelihoods for the MCMC sampler [Montepython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public). These likelihoods support analytical marginalization over the SN absolute magnitude. The approach is similar to that used in the SN Ia likelihoods of [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya).

The repo includes: 

* The PantheonPlus sample ([arXiv:2202.04077](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04077))
* The Union3 sample ([arXiv:2311.12098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12098))
* The DESY5 sample ([arXiv:2401.02929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02929))
